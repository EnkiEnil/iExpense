# iExpense

SwiftUI App - Xcode 14. 

This is a project while I am learning SwiftUI. Building a Expense tracking app, expanding on it with computer vision, text recognition, firebase login, and much more. 

iExpense is not something that will be launched in the Appstores. Its for educational purposes only. 

Stay tuned for more updates.
